It’s important to remember that it’s 
your responsibility to close the file. In most cases,
 upon termination of an application or script, a file will be closed eventually. However, there is no guarantee when exactly that will happen. This can lead to unwanted behavior including resource leaks. It’s also a best practice within Python (Pythonic) to make sure that your code behaves in a way that is well defined and reduces any unwanted behavior.soo

When you’re manipulating a file, there are two ways that you can use to ensure that a file is closed properly, even when encountering an error. The first way to close a file is to use the try-finally block:
The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even in cases of error. I highly recommend that you use the with statement as much as possible, as it allows for cleaner code and makes handling any unexpected errors easier for you.

Most likely, you’ll also want to use the second positional argument, mode. This argument is a string that contains multiple characters to represent how you want to open the file. The default and most common is 'r', which represents opening the file in read-only mode as a text file:
